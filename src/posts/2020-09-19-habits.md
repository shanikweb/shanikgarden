I really want to make writing more of a habit.

Alex linked us to Matt Webb's [15 rules for blogging](http://interconnected.org/home/2020/09/10/streak) the other day. Matt suggests that the way to publish often is to not be precious about what you're writing, and to focus on one thing at a time:

> One idea per post. If I find myself launching into another section, cut and paste the extra into a separate draft post, and tie off the original one with the word “Anyway.” Then publish.
