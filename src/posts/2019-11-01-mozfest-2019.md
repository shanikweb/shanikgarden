Last weekend was [MozFest](https://www.mozillafestival.org/en/), which is easily my favourite tech event. This is the second year I've attended, and although it was different from last year's experience it was just as exciting. At the end of the festival I always feel so energised and inspired.

As with last year, the most exciting part was the people I met and the conversations I had. As [Lai Yi](https://twitter.com/laiyiohlsen/status/1188749697550303241) mentions, it is so incredible to go to a conference about the Internet and speak to so many women. The direction that the Internet is heading these days can feel pretty bleak, so it is wonderful to spend a weekend with so many people who are trying their hardest to change its trajectory.

I've written up some more thoughts as [Common Knowledge](http://commonknowledge.coop/) on our [blog](https://commonknowledge.coop/writing/notes-from-mozfest-2019).
