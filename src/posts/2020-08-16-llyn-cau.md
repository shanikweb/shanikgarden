![A steep, mossy slope leading down to a clear, still lake](https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/8350585/original_dc6e16a70db939d85043a0945ff60c58.jpg?1597593435?bc=0)

A very misty Llyn Cau, halfway up [Cadair Idris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadair_Idris) in Wales.

We hiked most of this trail through low clouds. We noticed it getting warmer as we got closer to the peak, and then suddenly we were above the clouds and in brilliant sunshine.
