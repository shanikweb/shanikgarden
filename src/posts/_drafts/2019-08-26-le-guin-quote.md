> On Anarres, human beings are thought to possess a "natural incentive to work – his initiative, his spontaneous creative energy". In fact, the Pravic language uses the same word for "work" and "play." If work is coerced, hierarchical, or boring, then it is not considered work at all but "kleggich," meaning drudgery.
